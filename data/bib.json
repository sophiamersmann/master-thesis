      "abstract": "Mass-spectrometry-based proteomics has become an important component of biological research. Numerous proteomics methods have been developed to identify and quantify the proteins in biological and clinical samples1, identify pathways affected by endogenous and exogenous perturbations2, and characterize protein complexes3. Despite successes, the interpretation of vast proteomics datasets remains a challenge. There have been several calls for improvements and standardization of proteomics data analysis frameworks, as well as for an application- programming interface for proteomics data access4,5. In response, we have developed the ProteoWizard Toolkit, a robust set of open-source, software libraries and applications designed to facilitate proteomics research. The libraries implement the first-ever, non-commercial, unified data access interface for proteomics, bridging field-standard open formats and all common vendor formats. In addition, diverse software classes enable rapid development of vendor-agnostic proteomics software. Additionally, ProteoWizard projects and applications, building upon the core libraries, are becoming standard tools for enabling significant proteomics inquiries.",

Here we describe MaxQuant, an integrated suite of algorithms specifically developed for high-resolution, quantitative MS data. Using correlation analysis and graph theory, MaxQuant detects peaks, isotope clusters and stable amino acid isotope-labeled (SILAC) peptide pairs as three-dimensional objects in m/z, elution time and signal intensity space. By integrating multiple mass measurements and correcting for linear and nonlinear mass offsets, we achieve mass accuracy in the p.p.b. range, a sixfold increase over standard techniques. We increase the proportion of identified fragmentation spectra to 73\\% for SILAC peptide pairs via unambiguous assignment of isotope and missed-cleavage state and individual mass precision. MaxQuant automatically quantifies several hundred thousand peptides per SILAC-proteome experiment and allows statistically robust identification and quantification of \\textgreater4,000 proteins in mammalian cell lysates.",

This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications.

There are many different search engines, both commercial and open source, each employing a somewhat different technique for spectrum identification. The set of high-scoring peptide-spectrum matches for a defined set of input spectra differs markedly among the various search engine results; individual engines each provide unique correct identifications among a core set of correlative identifications. This has led to the approach of combining the results from multiple search engines to achieve improved analysis of each dataset.

We propose a method to properly combine the results from different database search methods to enhance the accuracy of peptide identifications. The database search methods included in our analysis are SEQUEST (v27 rev12), ProbID (v1.0), InsPecT (v20060505), Mascot (v2.1), X! Tandem (v2007.07.01.2), OMSSA (v2.0) and RAId\\_DbS. Using two data sets, one collected in profile mode and one collected in centroid mode, we tested the search performance of all 21 combinations of two search methods as well as all 35 possible combinations of three search methods. The results obtained from our study suggest that properly combining search methods does improve retrieval accuracy. In addition to performance results, we also describe the theoretical framework which in principle allows one to combine many independent scoring methods including de novo sequencing and spectral library searches. The correlations among different methods are also investigated in terms of common true positives, common false positives, and a global analysis. We find that the average correlation strength, between any pairwise combination of the seven methods studied, is usually smaller than the associated standard error. This indicates only weak correlation may be present among different methods and validates our approach in combining the search results. The usefulness of our approach is further confirmed by showing that the average cumulative number of false positive peptides agrees reasonably well with the combined E-value.

      "abstract": "An algorithm for reducing the time necessary to match a large set of peptide tandem mass spectra with a list of protein sequences is described. This algorithm breaks the process into multiple steps. A rapid survey step identifies all protein sequences that are reasonable candidates for a match with a set of tandem mass spectra. These candidates are then used as models, which are refined by detailed analysis of the set of tandem mass spectra for evidence of incomplete enzymatic hydroly-sis, non-specific hydrolysis and chemical modifications of amino acid residues resulting from either post-translational modifications or sample handling. Compared with current one-step methods for matching proteins to mass spectra, this multiple-step method can decrease the time required for the calculation by several orders of magnitude. The process of matching the sequences of peptides derived from a list of proteins with one or more tandem mass spectra of peptides derived experimentally from a sample is routi-nely performed in many laboratories. 1 This matching process is generally performed using commercial software imple-mentations of correlation algorithms, such as Sequest, 2,3 Mas-cot 4 and Sonar. 5 Algorithms that attempt to correlate manually analyzed partial sequences derived directly from tandem mass spectra with a list of protein sequences are also available. 6\u20138 The algorithms used to perform the correlation between known protein sequences and the set of tandem mass spectra obtained from an experimental protein digest mixture have many features in common. The list of known protein sequences is used to create a set of potential peptide sequences, based on the known cleavage specificity of a digesting enzyme. This list of protein sequences (often erroneously called a 'database') is selected based on the sequences that might reasonably have been present in a particular experimental situation. The calculated molecular masses of these peptides are compared with the precursor ion mass of a tandem spectrum, calculated from its observed mass-to-charge ratio and charge. If the difference between the peptide molecular mass and the experimental precursor ion mass is within a predetermined tolerance (t), a detailed correlation between the peptide sequence and the tandem mass spectrum is performed. This tolerance is usually stated as a symmetric range around the precusor ion's calculated mass, e.g., AE0.5 Da, or AE50 ppm. The detailed comparison is performed by calculating the masses that could be expected to be generated by the known fragmentation reactions involving the peptide backbone (commonly, b and y ions). The calculated masses are then compared with the observed masses and a goodness-of-fit score is generated, utilizing a symmetric tolerance for matching calculated and observed m/z values for the fragment ions (t f). This score may include additional factors, such as the intensities of individual peaks and the differences between observed and calculated masses. 9\u201312 Once the scores have been calculated for all of",

      "abstract": "Tandem mass spectra obtained from fragmenting peptide ions contain some peptide sequence specific informa- tion, but often there is not enough information to sequence the original peptide completely. Several proprietary software applications have been developed to attempt to match the spectra with a list of protein sequences that may contain the sequence of the peptide. The application TANDEM was written to provide the proteomics research community with a set of components that can be used to test new methods and algorithms for performing this type of sequence-to-data matching.",

      "abstract": "Mass spectrometry is a powerful technology for the analysis of large numbers of endogenous proteins. However, the analytical challenges associated with comprehensive identification and relative quantification of cellular proteomes have so far appeared to be insurmountable. Here, using advances in computational proteomics, instrument performance and sample preparation strategies, we compare protein levels of essentially all endogenous proteins in haploid yeast cells to their diploid counterparts. Our analysis spans more than four orders of magnitude in protein abundance with no discrimination against membrane or low level regulatory proteins. Stable-isotope labelling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) quantification was very accurate across the proteome, as demonstrated by one-to-one ratios of most yeast proteins. Key members of the pheromone pathway were specific to haploid yeast but others were unaltered, suggesting an efficient control mechanism of the mating response. Several retrotransposon-associated proteins were specific to haploid yeast. Gene ontology analysis pinpointed a significant change for cell wall components in agreement with geometrical considerations: diploid cells have twice the volume but not twice the surface area of haploid cells. Transcriptome levels agreed poorly with proteome changes overall. However, after filtering out low confidence microarray measurements, messenger RNA changes and SILAC ratios correlated very well for pheromone pathway components. Systems-wide, precise quantification directly at the protein level opens up new perspectives in post-genomics and systems biology.",

More recently the democratization of comprehensive proteomics technologies is enabling the determination of the cellular phenotype and the molecular events that define its dynamic state. Core proteomic technologies include MS to define protein sequence, protein:protein interactions, and protein PTMs. Key enabling technologies for proteomics are bioinformatic pipelines to identify, quantitate, and summarize these events. The Trans-Proteomics Pipeline (TPP) is a robust open-source standardized data processing pipeline for large-scale reproducible quantitative MS proteomics. It supports all major operating systems and instrument vendors via open data formats. Here, we provide a review of the overall proteomics workflow supported by the TPP, its major tools, and how it can be used in its various modes from desktop to cloud computing. We describe new features for the TPP, including data visualization functionality. We conclude by describing some common perils that affect the analysis of MS/MS datasets, as well as some major upcoming features.",

      "abstract": "As the speed of mass spectrometers, sophistication of sample fractionation, and complexity of experimental designs increase, the volume of tandem mass spectra requiring reliable automated analysis continues to grow. Software tools that quickly, effectively, and robustly determine the peptide associated with each spectrum with high confidence are sorely needed. Currently available tools that postprocess the output of sequence-database search engines use three techniques to distinguish the correct peptide identifications from the incorrect: statistical significance re-estimation, supervised machine learning scoring and prediction, and combining or merging of search engine results. We present a unifying framework that encompasses each of these techniques in a single model-free machine-learning framework that can be trained in an unsupervised manner. The predictor is trained on the fly for each new set of search results without user intervention, making it robust for different instruments, search engines, and search engine parameters. We demonstrate the performance of the technique using mixtures of known proteins and by using shuffled databases to estimate false discovery rates, from data acquired on three different instruments with two different ionization technologies. We show that this approach outperforms machine-learning techniques applied to a single search engine's output, and demonstrate that combining search engine results provides additional benefit. We show that the performance of the commercial Mascot tool can be bested by the machine-learning combination of two open-source tools X!Tandem and OMSSA, but that the use of all three search engines boosts performance further still. The Peptide identification Arbiter by Machine Learning (PepArML) unsupervised, model-free, combining framework can be easily extended to support an arbitrary number of additional searches, search engines, or specialized peptide\u2013spectrum match metrics for each spectrum data set. PepArML is open-source and is available from http://peparml.sourceforge.net .",

Automated interpretation of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra can be problematic, however, for a variety of reasons. As most sequence search engines return results even for 'unmatchable' spectra, proteome researchers must devise ways to distinguish correct from incorrect peptide identifications. The target-decoy search strategy represents a straightforward and effective way to manage this effort. Despite the apparent simplicity of this method, some controversy surrounds its successful application. Here we clarify our preferred methodology by addressing four issues based on observed decoy hit frequencies: (i) the major assumptions made with this database search strategy are reasonable; (ii) concatenated target-decoy database searches are preferable to separate target and decoy database searches; (iii) the theoretical error associated with target-decoy false positive (FP) rate measurements can be estimated; and (iv) alternate methods for constructing decoy databases are similarly effective once certain considerations are taken into account.",

A cross-correlation function is then used to provide a measurement of similarity between the mass-to-charge ratios for the fragment ions predicted from amino acid sequences obtained from the database and the fragment ions observed in the tandem mass spectrum. In general, a difference greater than 0.1 between the normalized cross-correlation functions of the first- and second-ranked search results indicates a successfol match between sequence and spectrum. Searches of species-specific protein databases with tandem mass spectra acquired from peptides obtained from the enzymatically digested total proteins of \\E. coli\\ and \\S. cerevisiae\\ cells allowed matchmg of the spectra to amino acid sequences within proteins of these organisms.

Because the score function lies at the heart of any peptide identification pipeline, this function greatly affects the final results of a proteomics assay. Consequently, valid statistical methods for assessing the quality of a given score function are extremely important. Previously, several research groups have used samples of known protein composition to assess the quality of a given score function. We demonstrate that this approach is problematic, because the outcome can depend on factors other than the score function itself. We then propose an alternative use of the same type of data to validate a score function. The central idea of our approach is that database matches that are not explained by any protein in the purified sample comprise a robust representation of incorrect matches. We apply our alternative assessment scheme to several commonly used score functions, and we show that our approach generates a reproducible measure of the calibration of a given peptide identification method. Furthermore, we show how our quality test can be useful in the development of novel score functions.",

SI(N) largely eliminated variances between replicate MS measurements, permitting quantitative reproducibility and highly significant quantification of thousands of proteins detected in replicate MS measurements of the same and distinct samples.

      "abstract": "Large-scale quantitative shotgun tandem mass spectrometry serves as a flexible proteomic platform for the systematic investigation of molecular processes perturbed by disease and the potential discovery of clinically relevant protein biomarkers associated with a particular pathology. Multiple innovative profiling techniques have been introduced with the aims of comprehensively identifying and quantifying the protein complements of human tissues and blood and enabling the systematic comparison of clinically relevant specimens. In this review, the novel computational methods that have been developed to maximize the amount of information inferred from the raw spectral datasets are explored, including innovative database search programs for more complete and confident protein identifications, improved normalization and data processing techniques to enhance statistical accuracy, and innovative algorithms for improved pattern discrimination and biomarker candidate ranking. Ultimately, integrative biomarker analyses that amalgamate the protein expression data generated by these approaches, together with data from high-throughput functional genomics, offer the possibility of identifying the mechanisms and causative factors that underlie complex human diseases, thereby improving both clinical outcomes and personalized treatment options.",

      "abstract": "LC-MS experiments can generate large quantities of data, for which a variety of database search engines are available to make peptide and protein identifications. Decoy databases are becoming widely used to place statistical confidence in result sets, allowing the false discovery rate (FDR) to be estimated. Different search engines produce different identification sets so employing more than one search engine could result in an increased number of peptides (and proteins) being identified, if an appropriate mechanism for combining data can be defined. We have developed a search engine independent score, based on FDR, which allows peptide identifications from different search engines to be combined, called the FDR Score. The results demonstrate that the observed FDR is significantly different when analysing the set of identifications made by all three search engines, by each pair of search engines or by a single search engine. Our algorithm assigns identifications to groups according to the set of search engines that have made the identification, and re-assigns the score (combined FDR Score). The combined FDR Score can differentiate between correct and incorrect peptide identifications with high accuracy, allowing on average 35\\% more peptide identifications to be made at a fixed FDR than using a single search engine.",

We argue that evaluating the error rates of peptide identifications is not unlike computing generating functions in combinatorics. We show that the generating functions and their derivatives (spectral energy and spectral probability) represent new features of tandem mass spectra that, similarly to A-scores, significantly improve peptide identifications. Furthermore, the spectral probability provides a rigorous solution to the problem of computing statistical significance of spectral identifications. The spectral energy/probability approach improves the sensitivity-specificity tradeoff of existing MS/MS search tools, addresses the notoriously difficult problem of \"one-hit-wonders\" in mass spectrometry, and often eliminates the need for decoy database searches. We therefore argue that the generating function approach has the potential to increase the number of peptide identifications in MS/MS searches.",

      "abstract": "Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is frequently used in the identification of peptides and proteins. Typical proteomic experiments rely on algorithms such as SEQUEST and MASCOT to compare thousands of tandem mass spectra against the theoretical fragment ion spectra of peptides in a database. The probabilities that these spectrum-to-sequence assignments are correct can be determined by statistical software such as PeptideProphet or through estimations based on reverse or decoy databases. However, many of the software applications that assign probabilities for MS/MS spectra to sequence matches were developed using training data sets from 3D ion-trap mass spectrometers. Given the variety of types of mass spectrometers that have become commercially available over the last 5 years, we sought to generate a data set of reference data covering multiple instrumentation platforms to facilitate both the refinement of existing computational approaches and the development of novel software tools. We analyzed the proteolytic peptides in a mixture of tryptic digests of 18 proteins, named the \"ISB standard protein mix\", using 8 different mass spectrometers. These include linear and 3D ion traps, two quadrupole time-of-flight platforms (qq-TOF), and two MALDI-TOF-TOF platforms. The resulting data set, which has been named the Standard Protein Mix Database, consists of over 1.1 million spectra in 150+ replicate runs on the mass spectrometers. The data were inspected for quality of separation and searched using SEQUEST. All data, including the native raw instrument and mzXML formats and the PeptideProphet validated peptide assignments, are available at http://regis-web.systemsbiology.net/PublicDatasets/",

      "abstract": "Shotgun proteomics using mass spectrometry is a powerful method for protein identification but suffers limited sensitivity in complex samples. Integrating peptide identifications from multiple database search engines is a promising strategy to increase the number of peptide identifications and reduce the volume of unassigned tandem mass spectra. Existing methods pool statistical significance scores such as p-values or posterior probabilities of peptide-spectrum matches (PSMs) from multiple search engines after high scoring peptides have been assigned to spectra, but these methods lack reliable control of identification error rates as data are integrated from different search engines. We developed a statistically coherent method for integrative analysis, termed MSblender. MSblender converts raw search scores from search engines into a probability score for every possible PSM and properly accounts for the correlation between search scores. The method reliably estimates false discovery rates and identifies more PSMs than any single search engine at the same false discovery rate. Increased identifications increment spectral counts for most proteins and allow quantification of proteins that would not have been quantified by individual search engines. We also demonstrate that enhanced quantification contributes to improve sensitivity in differential expression analyses.",

      "abstract": "Ribosome biogenesis, a central and essential cellular process, occurs through sequential association and mutual co-folding of protein-RNA constituents in a well-defined assembly pathway. Here, we construct a network of co-evolving nucleotide/amino acid residues within the ribosome and demonstrate that assembly constraints are strong predictors of co-evolutionary patterns. Predictors of co-evolution include a wide spectrum of structural reconstitution events, such as cooperativity phenomenon, protein-induced rRNA reconstitutions, molecular packing of different rRNA domains, protein-rRNA recognition, etc. A correlation between folding rate of small globular proteins and their topological features is known. We have introduced an analogous topological characteristic for co-evolutionary network of ribosome, which allows us to differentiate between rRNA regions subjected to rapid reconstitutions from those hindered by kinetic traps. Furthermore, co-evolutionary patterns provide a biological basis for deleterious mutation sites and further allow prediction of potential antibiotic targeting sites. Understanding assembly pathways of multicomponent macromolecules remains a key challenge in biophysics. Our study provides a 'proof of concept' that directly relates co-evolution to biophysical interactions during multicomponent assembly and suggests predictive power to identify candidates for critical functional interactions as well as for assembly-blocking antibiotic target sites.",

      "abstract": "Lipid membranes structurally define the outer surface and internal organelles of cells. The multitude of proteins embedded in lipid bilayers are clearly functionally important, yet they remain poorly defined. Even today, integral membrane proteins represent a special challenge for current large scale shotgun proteomics methods. Here we used endothelial cell plasma membranes isolated directly from lung tissue to test the effectiveness of four different mass spectrometry-based methods, each with multiple replicate measurements, to identify membrane proteins. In doing so, we substantially expanded this membranome to 1,833 proteins, including \\textgreater500 lipid-embedded proteins. The best method combined SDS-PAGE prefractionation with trypsin digestion of gel slices to generate peptides for seamless and continuous two-dimensional LC/MS/MS analysis. This three-dimensional separation method outperformed current widely used two-dimensional methods by significantly enhancing protein identifications including single and multiple pass transmembrane proteins; \\textgreater30\\% are lipid-embedded proteins. It also profoundly improved protein coverage, sensitivity, and dynamic range of detection and substantially reduced the amount of sample and the number of replicate mass spectrometry measurements required to achieve 95\\% analytical completeness. Such expansion in comprehensiveness requires a trade-off in heavy instrument time but bodes well for future advancements in truly defining the ever important membranome with its potential in network-based systems analysis and the discovery of disease biomarkers and therapeutic targets. This analytical strategy can be applied to other subcellular fractions and should extend the comprehensiveness of many future organellar proteomics pursuits.",

In more complicated mixtures, for example, whole cell lysates, data-dependent acquisition incompletely samples among the peptide ions present rather than acquiring tandem mass spectra for all ions available. We analyzed the sampling process and developed a statistical model to accurately predict the level of sampling expected for mixtures of a specific complexity. The model also predicts how many analyses are required for saturated sampling of a complex protein mixture. For a yeast-soluble cell lysate 10 analyses are required to reach a 95\\% saturation level on protein identifications based on our model. The statistical model also suggests a relationship between the level of sampling observed for a protein and the relative abundance of the protein in the mixture.

Furthermore, the identification of proteins and their specific properties require the use of multiple independent bioinformatics tools and several database search algorithms to process the same datasets. In order to facilitate and increase the speed of data analysis, there is a need for an integrated platform that would allow a comprehensive profiling of thousands of peptides and proteins in a single process through the simultaneous exploitation of multiple complementary algorithms.ResultsWe have established a new proteomics pipeline designated as APP that fulfills these objectives using a complete series of tools freely available from open sources. APP automates the processing of proteomics tasks such as peptide identification, validation and quantitation from LC-MS/MS data and allows easy integration of many separate proteomics tools. Distributed processing is at the core of APP, allowing the processing of very large datasets using any combination of Windows/Linux physical or virtual computing resources.ConclusionsAPP provides distributed computing nodes that are simple to set up, greatly relieving the need for separate IT competence when handling large datasets.

      "abstract": "Despite a central role in immunity, antibody neutralization of virus infection is poorly understood. Here we show how the neutralization and persistence of adenovirus type 5, a prevalent nonenveloped human virus, are dependent upon the intracellular antibody receptor TRIM21. Cells with insufficient amounts of TRIM21 are readily infected, even at saturating concentrations of neutralizing antibody. Conversely, high TRIM21 expression levels decrease the persistent fraction of the infecting virus and allows neutralization by as few as 1.6 antibody molecules per virus. The direct interaction between TRIM21 and neutralizing antibody is essential, as single-point mutations within the TRIM21-binding site in the Fc region of a potently neutralizing antibody impair neutralization. However, infection at high multiplicity can saturate TRIM21 and overcome neutralization. These results provide insight into the mechanism and importance of a newly discovered, effector-driven process of antibody neutralization of nonenveloped viruses.",

      "abstract": "As proteomic MS has increased in throughput, so has the demand to catalogue the increasing number of peptides and proteins observed by the community using this technique. As in other 'omics' fields, this brings obvious scientific benefits such as sharing of results and prevention of unnecessary repetition, but also provides technical insights, such as the ability to compare proteome coverage between different laboratories, or between different proteomic platforms. Journals are also moving towards mandating that proteomics data be submitted to public repositories upon publication. In response to these demands, several web-based repositories have been established to store protein and peptide identifications derived from MS data, and a similar number of peptide identification software pipelines have emerged to deliver identifications to these repositories. This paper reviews the latest developments in public domain peptide and protein identification databases and describes the analysis pipelines that feed them. Recent applications of the tools to pertinent biological problems are examined, and through comparing and contrasting the capabilities of each system, the issues facing research users of web-based repositories are explored. Future developments and mechanisms to enhance system functionality and user-interfacing opportunities are also suggested.",

      "abstract": "A scoring procedure is described for measuring the quality of the results for protein identifications obtained from spectral matching of MS/MS data using the Sequest database search program. The scoring system is essentially probabilistic and operates by estimating the probability that a protein identification has come about by chance. The probability is based on the number of identified peptides from the protein, the total number of identified peptides, and the fraction of distinct tryptic peptides from the database that are present in the identified protein. The score is not strictly a probability, as it also incorporates information about the quality of the individual peptide matches. The result of using Qscore on a large test set of data was similar to that achieved using approaches that validate individual spectral matches, with only a narrow overlap in scores between identified proteins and false positive matches. In direct comparison with a published method of evaluating Sequest results, Qscore was able to identify an equivalent number of proteins without any identifiable false positive assignments. Qscore greatly reduces the number of Sequest protein identifications that have to be validated manually. \\textcopyright 2002 American Society for Mass Spectrometry.",

The commonly used methods for assigning peptide sequences to MS/MS spectra are critically discussed and compared, from basic strategies to advanced multi-stage approaches. A particular attention is paid to the problem of false-positive identifications. Existing statistical approaches for assessing the significance of peptide to spectrum matches are surveyed, ranging from single-spectrum approaches such as expectation values to global error rate estimation procedures such as false discovery rates and posterior probabilities. The importance of using auxiliary discriminant information (mass accuracy, peptide separation coordinates, digestion properties, and etc.) is discussed, and advanced computational approaches for joint modeling of multiple sources of information are presented. This review also includes a detailed analysis of the issues affecting the interpretation of data at the protein level, including the amplification of error rates when going from peptide to protein level, and the ambiguities in inferring the identifies of sample proteins in the presence of shared peptides. Commonly used methods for computing protein-level confidence scores are discussed in detail. The review concludes with a discussion of several outstanding computational issues. \\textcopyright 2010 Elsevier B.V.",

Using peptide assignments to spectra generated from a sample of 18 purified proteins, as well as complex H. influenzae and Halobacterium samples, the model is shown to produce probabilities that are accurate and have high power to discriminate correct from incorrect protein identifications.

Currently, the primary bottleneck in this type of experiment is computational. Existing algorithms for interpreting mass spectra are slow and fail to identify a large proportion of the given spectra. We describe a database search program called Crux that reimplements and extends the widely used database search program Sequest. For speed, Crux uses a peptide indexing scheme to rapidly retrieve candidate peptides for a given spectrum. For each peptide in the target database, Crux generates shuffled decoy peptides on the fly, providing a good null model and, hence, accurate false discovery rate estimates. Crux also implements two recently described postprocessing methods: a p value calculation based upon fitting a Weibull distribution to the observed scores, and a semisupervised method that learns to discriminate between target and decoy matches. Both methods significantly improve the overall rate of peptide identification. Crux is implemented in C and is distributed with source code freely to noncommercial users.",

      "abstract": "Optimal performance of LC-MS/MS platforms is critical to generating high quality proteomics data. Although individual laboratories have developed quality control samples, there is no widely available performance standard of biological complexity (and associated reference data sets) for benchmarking of platform performance for analysis of complex biological proteomes across different laboratories in the community. Individual preparations of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae proteome have been used extensively by laboratories in the proteomics community to characterize LC-MS platform performance. The yeast proteome is uniquely attractive as a performance standard because it is the most extensively characterized complex biological proteome and the only one associated with several large scale studies estimating the abundance of all detectable proteins. In this study, we describe a standard operating protocol for large scale production of the yeast performance standard and offer aliquots to the community through the National Institute of Standards and Technology where the yeast proteome is under development as a certified reference material to meet the long term needs of the community. Using a series of metrics that characterize LC-MS performance, we provide a reference data set demonstrating typical performance of commonly used ion trap instrument platforms in expert laboratories; the results provide a basis for laboratories to benchmark their own performance, to improve upon current methods, and to evaluate new technologies. Additionally, we demonstrate how the yeast reference, spiked with human proteins, can be used to benchmark the power of proteomics platforms for detection of differentially expressed proteins at different levels of concentration in a complex matrix, thereby providing a metric to evaluate and minimize pre-analytical and analytical variation in comparative proteomics experiments.",

While decoy databases have numerous advantages, they double the run time and are not applicable to all peptide identification problems such as error-tolerant or de novo searches or the large-scale identification of cross-linked peptides. Instead, we propose a fast, simple and robust mixture modeling approach to estimate the confidence of peptide identifications without the need for decoy database searches, which automatically checks whether its underlying assumptions are fulfilled. This approach is then evaluated on 41 LC/MS data sets of varying complexity and origin. The results are very similar to those of the decoy database strategy at a negligible computational cost. Our approach is applicable not only to standard protein identification workflows, but also to proteomics problems for which meaningful decoy databases cannot be constructed.",

Manual analysis and direct spectral comparison reveal that scores from two commonly used search programs (Sequest and Mascot) validate less than half of potentially identifiable MS/MS spectra (class positive) from shotgun analyses of the human erythroleukemia K562 cell line. Here we demonstrate increased sensitivity and accuracy using a focused search strategy along with a peptide sequence validation script that does not rely exclusively on XCorr or Mowse scores generated by Sequest or Mascot, but uses consensus between the search programs, along with chemical properties and scores describing the nature of the fragmentation spectrum (ion score and RSP). The approach yielded 4.2\\% false positive and 8\\% false negative frequencies in peptide assignments. The protein profile is then assembled from peptide assignments using a novel peptide-centric protein nomenclature that more accurately reports protein variants that contain identical peptide sequences. An Isoform Resolver algorithm ensures that the protein count is not inflated by variants in the protein database, eliminating approximately 25\\% of redundant proteins. Analysis of soluble proteins from a human K562 cells identified 5130 unique proteins, with approximately 100 false positive protein assignments.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this work is to develop and verify statistical models for protein identification using peptide identifications derived from the results of tandem mass spectral database searches. Recently we have presented a probabilistic model for peptide identification that uses hypergeometric distribution to approximate fragment ion matches of database peptide sequences to experimental tandem mass spectra. Here we apply statistical models to the database search results to validate protein identifications. For this we formulate the protein identification problem in terms of two independent models, two-hypothesis binomial and multinomial models, which use the hypergeometric probabilities and cross-correlation scores, respectively. Each database search result is assumed to be a probabilistic event. The Bernoulli event has two outcomes: a protein is either identified or not. The probability of identifying a protein at each Bernoulli event is determined from relative length of the protein in the database (the null hypothesis) or the hypergeometric probability scores of the protein's peptides (the alternative hypothesis). We then calculate the binomial probability that the protein will be observed a certain number of times (number of database matches to its peptides) given the size of the data set (number of spectra) and the probability of protein identification at each Bernoulli event. The ratio of the probabilities from these two hypotheses (maximum likelihood ratio) is used as a test statistic to discriminate between true and false identifications. The significance and confidence levels of protein identifications are calculated from the model distributions. The multinomial model combines the database search results and generates an observed frequency distribution of cross-correlation scores (grouped into bins) between experimental spectra and identified amino acid sequences. The frequency distribution is used to generate p-value probabilities of each score bin. The probabilities are then normalized with respect to score bins to generate normalized probabilities of all score bins. A protein identification probability is the multinomial probability of observing the given set of peptide scores. To reduce the effect of random matches, we employ a marginalized multinomial model for small values of cross-correlation scores. We demonstrate that the combination of the two independent methods provides a useful tool for protein identification from results of database search using tandem mass spectra. A receiver operating characteristic curve demonstrates the sensitivity and accuracy level of the approach. The shortcomings of the models are related to the cases when protein assignment is based on unusual peptide fragmentation patterns that dominate over the model encoded in the peptide identification process. We have implemented the approach in a program called PROT\\_PROBE.",

The method employs a hypergeometric distribution to model frequencies of matches between fragment ions predicted for peptide sequences with a specific (M + H)+ value (at some mass tolerance) in a protein sequence database and an experimental tandem mass spectrum. The hypergeometric distribution constitutes null hypothesis-all peptide matches to a tandem mass spectrum are random. It is used to generate a score characterizing the randomness of a database sequence match to an experimental tandem mass spectrum and to determine the level of significance of the null hypothesis. For each tandem mass spectrum and database search, a peptide is identified that has the least probability of being a random match to the spectrum and the corresponding level of significance of the null hypothesis is determined. To check the validity of the hypergeometric model in describing fragment ion matches, we used chi2 test. The distribution of frequencies and corresponding hypergeometric probabilities are generated for each tandem mass spectrum. No proteolytic cleavage specificity is used to create the peptide sequences from the database. We do not use any empirical probabilities in this method. The scores generated by the hypergeometric model do not have a significant molecular weight bias and are reasonably independent of database size. The approach has been implemented in a database search algorithm, PEP\\_PROBE. By using a large set of tandem mass spectra derived from a set of peptides created by digestion of a collection of known proteins using four different proteases, a false positive rate of 5\\% is demonstrated.",

      "abstract": "In any high-throughput scientific study, it is often essential to estimate the percent of findings that are actually incorrect. This percentage is called the false discovery rate (abbreviated \"FDR\"), and it is an invariant (albeit, often unknown) quantity for any well-formed study. In proteomics, it has become common practice to incorrectly conflate the protein FDR (the percent of identified proteins that are actually absent) with protein-level target-decoy, a particular method for estimating the protein-level FDR. In this manner, the challenges of one approach have been used as the basis for an argument that the field should abstain from protein-level FDR analysis altogether or even the suggestion that the very notion of a protein FDR is flawed. As we demonstrate in simple but accurate simulations, not only is the protein-level FDR an invariant concept, when analyzing large data sets, the failure to properly acknowledge it or to correct for multiple testing can result in large, unrecognized errors, whereby thousands of absent proteins (and, potentially every protein in the FASTA database being considered) can be incorrectly identified.",

      "abstract": "The combination of tandem mass spectrometry and sequence database searching is the method of choice for the identification of peptides and the mapping of proteomes. Over the last several years, the volume of data generated in proteomic studies has increased dramatically, which challenges the computational approaches previously developed for these data. Furthermore, a multitude of search engines have been developed that identify different, overlapping subsets of the sample peptides from a particular set of tandem mass spectrometry spectra. We present iProphet, the new addition to the widely used open-source suite of proteomic data analysis tools Trans-Proteomics Pipeline. Applied in tandem with PeptideProphet, it provides more accurate representation of the multilevel nature of shotgun proteomic data. iProphet combines the evidence from multiple identifications of the same peptide sequences across different spectra, experiments, precursor ion charge states, and modified states. It also allows accurate and effective integration of the results from multiple database search engines applied to the same data. The use of iProphet in the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline increases the number of correctly identified peptides at a constant false discovery rate as compared with both PeptideProphet and another state-of-the-art tool Percolator. As the main outcome, iProphet permits the calculation of accurate posterior probabilities and false discovery rate estimates at the level of sequence identical peptide identifications, which in turn leads to more accurate probability estimates at the protein level. Fully integrated with the Trans-Proteomics Pipeline, it supports all commonly used MS instruments, search engines, and computer platforms. The performance of iProphet is demonstrated on two publicly available data sets: data from a human whole cell lysate proteome profiling experiment representative of typical proteomic data sets, and from a set of Streptococcus pyogenes experiments more representative of organism-specific composite data sets.",

Whereas we typically control the type I error rate for a single-hypothesis test, a compound error rate is controlled for multiple-hypothesis tests. For example, controlling the false discovery rate FDR traditionally involves intricate sequential p-value rejection methods based on the observed data. Whereas a sequential p-value method fixes the error rate and estimates its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach\u2014we fix the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate. This new approach offers increased applicability, accuracy and power.We apply the methodology to both the positive false discovery rate pFDR and FDR, and provide evidence for its benefits. It is shown that pFDR is probably the quantity of interest over FDR. Also discussed is the calculation of the q-value, the pFDR analogue of the p-value, which eliminates the need to set the error rate beforehand as is traditionally done. Some simple numerical examples are presented that show that this new approach can yield an increase of over eight times in power compared with the Benjamini\u2013Hochberg FDR method.",

For shotgun proteomics, one of the inherent problems of interpreting data is that the measured analytes are peptides and not the actual proteins themselves. As some proteins share proteolytic peptides, there might be more than one possible causative set of proteins resulting in a given set of peptides and there is a need for mechanisms that infer proteins from lists of detected peptides. A weakness of commercially available samples of known content is that they consist of proteins that are deliberately selected for producing tryptic peptides that are unique to a single protein. Unfortunately, such samples do not expose any complications in protein inference. Hence, for a realistic benchmark of protein inference procedures, there is a need for samples of known content where the present proteins share ...",

      "abstract": "A main bottleneck in proteomics is the downstream biological analysis of highly multivariate quantitative protein abundance data generated using mass-spectrometry-based analysis. We developed the Perseus software platform (http://www.perseus-framework.org) to support biological and biomedical researchers in interpreting protein quantification, interaction and post-translational modification data. Perseus contains a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for high-dimensional omics data analysis covering normalization, pattern recognition, time-series analysis, cross-omics comparisons and multiple-hypothesis testing. A machine learning module supports the classification and validation of patient groups for diagnosis and prognosis, and it also detects predictive protein signatures. Central to Perseus is a user-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete documentation of computational methods used in a publication. All activities in Perseus are realized as plugins, and users can extend the software by programming their own, which can be shared through a plugin store. We anticipate that Perseus's arsenal of algorithms and its intuitive usability will empower interdisciplinary analysis of complex large data sets.",

      "abstract": "Manual analysis of mass spectrometry data is a current bottleneck in high throughput proteomics. In particular, the need to manually validate the results of mass spectrometry database searching algorithms can be prohibitively time-consuming. Development of software tools that attempt to quantify the confidence in the assignment of a protein or peptide identity to a mass spectrum is an area of active interest. We sought to extend work in this area by investigating the potential of recent machine learning algorithms to improve the accuracy of these approaches and as a flexible framework for accommodating new data features. Specifically we demonstrated the ability of boosting and random forest approaches to improve the discrimination of true hits from false positive identifications in the results of mass spectrometry database search engines compared with thresholding and other machine learning approaches. We accommodated additional attributes obtainable from database search results, including a factor addressing proton mobility. Performance was evaluated using publically available electrospray data and a new collection of MALDI data generated from purified human reference proteins.",

      "abstract": "Liquid chromatography coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an important technique for detecting peptides in proteomics studies. Here, we present an open source software tool, termed IPeak, a peptide identification pipeline that is designed to combine the Percolator post-processing algorithm and multi-search strategy to enhance the sensitivity of peptide identifications without compromising accuracy. IPeak provides a graphical user interface (GUI) as well as a command-line interface, which is implemented in JAVA and can work on all three major operating system platforms: Windows, Linux/Unix and OS X. IPeak has been designed to work with the mzIdentML standard from the Proteomics Standards Initiative (PSI) as an input and output, and also been fully integrated into the associated mzidLibrary project, providing access to the overall pipeline, as well as modules for calling Percolator on individual search engine result files. The integration thus enables IPeak (and Percolator) to be used in conjunction with any software packages implementing the mzIdentML data standard. IPeak is freely available and can be downloaded under an Apache 2.0 license at https://code.google.com/p/mzidentml-lib/.",

      "abstract": "Peptide identification using tandem mass spectrometry is a core technology in proteomics. Latest generations of mass spectrometry instruments enable the use of electron transfer dissociation (ETD) to complement collision induced dissociation (CID) for peptide fragmentation. However, a critical limitation to the use of ETD has been optimal database search software. Percolator is a post-search algorithm, which uses semi-supervised machine learning to improve the rate of peptide spectrum identifications (PSMs) together with providing reliable significance measures. We have previously interfaced the Mascot search engine with Percolator and demonstrated sensitivity and specificity benefits with CID data. Here, we report recent developments in the Mascot Percolator V2.0 software including an improved feature calculator and support for a wider range of ion series. The updated software is applied to the analysis of several CID and ETD fragmented peptide data sets. This version of Mascot Percolator increases the number of CID PSMs by up to 80\\% and ETD PSMs by up to 60\\% at a 0.01 q-value (1\\% false discovery rate) threshold over a standard Mascot search, notably recovering PSMs from high charge state precursor ions. The greatly increased number of PSMs and peptide coverage afforded by Mascot Percolator has enabled a fuller assessment of CID/ETD complementarity to be performed. Using a data set of CID and ETcaD spectral pairs, we find that at a 1\\% false discovery rate, the overlap in peptide identifications by CID and ETD is 83\\%, which is significantly higher than that obtained using either stand-alone Mascot (69\\%) or OMSSA (39\\%). We conclude that Mascot Percolator is a highly sensitive and accurate post-search algorithm for peptide identification and allows direct comparison of peptide identifications using multiple alternative fragmentation techniques.",
